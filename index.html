    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>I'm a graduate of Worcester Polytechnic
                Institute's Interactive Media and Game Design program. Starting in August of 2019,
                I'll be starting graduate school at the same institution. Beyond this, I'm an
                independent game developer and designer, writer, and programmer. I have a
                soft spot for outrageously hot coffee and write a lot of poetry that no one will ever
                read.</p>
    <h4>Why do I make games?</h4>
    <p>The short answer is that I love doing it. Games are my favorite storytelling medium.
                Players can experience the narrative that you create through something as joyful as
                the act of play.</p>
    <h4>What kind of games do I want to make?</h4>
    <p> Well, I make a lot of games about my experiences as a transgender man - which, I feel,
                answers this question pretty thoroughly. I want to make games that are honest and
                game that are reevant to my lived experiences.</p>

    <h5>Perspective Shift</h5>
    <img src="images/perspective_shift/ps1.PNG" alt="Perspective Shift" style = "width: 400px" class="center">

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>Perspective Shift is a cooperative strategy board game in which players build structures for other people’s
        perspectives that echo abstract images. These images can be found in a quickly growing pool of goal cards.
        Players must work together to clear goal cards before the pool becomes too large. This game serves as an instrument
        to investigate nonverbal forms of communication that occur during the act of play.</p>
    <p>The game’s current design focuses on envisioning the perspectives of other players and is completely selfless.
        Players still collaboratively build a structure in the center of the board, but instead it’s for others.
        There is a pool of goal cards that exists face up on the board. After a player takes their turn, mentally
        selecting a goal card to try and reconstruct for another player, another card is flipped over into the goal
        card pool. All players lose if this goal card pool gets too large. Goal cards can be cleared from the pool by
        satisfying them. Once a player believes that another player can see the image on a goal card in the current structure,
        they signal to that player with a declaration card. If that player chooses the correct goal card, then it is removed from
        the pool. There are also event cards that can be drawn that rotate the board or alter it physically, changing the views of
        each player. There is also a round based token system that rewards players for satisfying goal cards that have been in play
        for long periods of time.

    <p></br><i>All of the characters have have just landed at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport and are
        excited about attending the Raleigh Innovations Technology Conference at the other end of the city.
        Unfortunately, they have taken advantage of the free refreshments during their respective flights
        and really “gotta go.” The characters must make their way through the streets of Raleigh trying to
        find a comfortable restroom to empty their bladder before reaching the convention. </i></p>

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>Gotta Go is a progression based board game with resource management elements that tackles the issue
        of anti-transgender bathroom legislation in the United States. It
        features a cast of colorful characters with unique gender identities that are severely underrepresented
        in popular culture. Players navigate through the city of Raleigh, North Carolina collecting bladder tokens
        and trying to find restrooms that their character feels comfortable using. The event card system juxtaposes
        humorous events with realistic and sombre negative events that are drawn when a character is forced to use
        a restroom that does not align with their identity.</p>

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>Bound is an art, cognitive empathy game. It's an autobiographical artifact that exists to create an impactful experience for its players
            and encourage them to consider the physical limitations that wearing a binder may impose on the transmasculine community. It does this
            by recreating the mental and physical stress associated with running in a chest binder through its exploration and rhythm game mechanics.</p>
