    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Leo Bunyea! I'm currently a Master’s student in Interactive Media and Game Design at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
        and a HASTAC scholar. I'm also an independent game designer, writer, and programmer. Many of my projects
        are informed by my experience exploring my identity as a transgender man. Ultimately, I use my skill set as a
        developer to advocate for queer and marginalized people.</p>
    <h4>What are my research interests?</h4>
    <p>My research interests exist at the intersection of gaming culture and queerness. I am particularly invested in the social dimensions
    of transgender identities and rights.</p>

    <h4>What am I working on right now?</h4>
    <b><p> 1) Leo Bunyea, Jennifer deWinter. “An Analysis of Community Management: Clever Endeavor Games.” For Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy. </p></b>

   <i><p>This is a project which maps social networks and community management in independent game companies with a specific focus on Clever Endeavor Games.
        We argue that multi-modal writers working professionally as community managers (building and supporting fan communities) need to attend to an ecology
        of social media, web-based activities, and physical events, all of which are self-referential in a web, to reach and support a distributed and diverse
        fannish community. We have done visual representations of this, have conducted video interviews with Clever Endeavor's community manager, and benchmarked
       to this fairly understudied area of professional, digital communication. </p></i>
    <br>

    <b><p>2) Leo Bunyea, Gillian Smith. “An Analysis of Design Decisions on Reinforcing Stereotypes in Games.” For ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction. </p></b>
    <i><p> This paper discusses a diversity analysis of the character assets of the open source game engine StudyCrafter and its implications for inclusive design
        practices. It unpacks the results of several subjects who visually code these assets in the context of the game engine and also in the context of student projects.
        We argue that game designers, through the affordances that they provide, can unintentionally reinforce stereotypes. </p></i>
    <br>

    <b><p>3) Leo Bunyea, “Using Participatory Design Practices To Reimagine Systems of Gender in Final Fantasy XIV." For my Master's Thesis.</p></b>
    <i><p>Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games or MMORPGs consist of large worlds, intricate quest lines and diverse communities of players.
        Many facets of MMORPGs are designed to be completed in the context of a group; instanced dungeons, challenging side quests, and player-vs.-player
        arenas. Additionally, each zone is populated by other players piloting avatars into droves of monsters or NPCs. With a platform that relies so heavily
        on social interaction, a player’s avatar becomes an integral component of their identity. </p>
      <p>  However, current character creation tools do not allow players to capture a realistic variety of bodies and identities.
        The selection of an avatar’s gender is often a binary one that is reliant on secondary sex characteristics. Male characters
        are represented with stereotypical, hyper-muscular frames while female characters are represented with slender, scantily clad ones.
        Options for skin tone and hair texture are frequently white-washed or nonexistent. Players who belong to marginalized
          communities may find it difficult to create an avatar that they can identify with. </p>
       <p> While all the aforementioned shortcomings of these tools warrant their own individual study, this project focuses on gender declaration
        systems. The object of this study is on one specific MMORPG, “Final Fantasy XIV” (abbreviated to FFXIV), selected due to
        the depth of its avatar creation tool. This project will use participatory design practices to iteratively incorporate the tacit knowledge of
           self-identifying, active, queer players in the reimagination of FFXIV’s existing avatar creation tool.</p></i>

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>“Athena At Night” is a steampunk, popup puzzle, visual book about a girl who defies fate through hard work and intellect.
        “Athena At Night” is targeted towards children from five to nine years of age. On this project, I served as lead artist and lead writer.</p>
    <p>
        Athena is a princess who has been cursed by the stars themselves to sleep while others in her castle are awake and be awake
        while others are asleep. Her parents have kept her confined to a specific wing of the castle, fearing that something terrible
        may happen to her without their supervision. Longing for an escape from both her loneliness and her physical constraints, Athena
        begins to build a flying machine. When the machine is eventually complete, she pilots it into the night sky breaking the curse.

    <p>The Containment Breach: Escape Room was an escape room built in six weeks and run by thirty graduate students on WPI's campus. For this project, I was
        on the writing team and responsible for generating any text needed for puzzles needed within the room. I also scripted, filmed, and edited a video to
        loop in the lobby, designed the lobby layout, and helped build the physical set.</p>

    <h4>Table-top Games</h4>
    <h5>Perspective Shift</h5>
    <img src="images/perspective_shift/ps1.PNG" alt="Perspective Shift" style = "width: 400px" class="center">

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>“Perspective Shift” is a social board game which combines and facilitates physical construction and conversation
        to enable open communication between its players. Platforms which encourage this nature of communication are
        increasingly necessary in the United States considering the nation’s current socio-political climate. The design
        of “Perspective Shift” is informed by practices used in play therapy to help participants feel more comfortable
        being vulnerable. Perspective Shift is subversive in its treatment of traditional goals and fail states. The
        context in which various game pieces are used is negotiated by the players themselves.</p>
    <p>“Perspective Shift’s” gameplay is segmented into four phases; negotiation, construction, drawing, and preservation.
        Each phase establishes conditions for the next phase and adds an additional, necessary layer of meaning to the whole
        experience. The first phase acts as a form of consent about what topic and feelings players are willing to openly
        discuss. The second nurtures a structured conversation that makes space for every person to contribute. The third
        phase acts as an exercise in literal perspective-taking and subsequently the formulation of other perspectives into
        language. The last phase, after players have engaged in meaningful conversation and thought about everyone else’s
        point of view, asks players to reach a consensus.

    <p></br><i>All of the characters have have just landed at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport and are
        excited about attending the Raleigh Innovations Technology Conference at the other end of the city.
        Unfortunately, they have taken advantage of the free refreshments during their respective flights
        and really “gotta go.” The characters must make their way through the streets of Raleigh trying to
        find a comfortable restroom to empty their bladder before reaching the convention. </i></p>

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>Gotta Go is a progression based board game with resource management elements that tackles the issue
        of anti-transgender bathroom legislation in the United States. It
        features a cast of colorful characters with unique gender identities that are severely underrepresented
        in popular culture. Players navigate through the city of Raleigh, North Carolina collecting bladder tokens
        and trying to find restrooms that their character feels comfortable using. The event card system juxtaposes
        humorous events with realistic and sombre negative events that are drawn when a character is forced to use
        a restroom that does not align with their identity.</p>

        This presentation explores gender identity and diversity in the context of modern media.
        It will cover topics such as the complexity of "passing," what it means to medically
        transition, and problematic representation. This talk will give insight into how to
        respectfully portray trans characters in games and discuss trans issues in everyday life.
