            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>I openly identify as a transgender man.
                I feel that my unique social perspective is an important
                element of the creativity that I bring to any project.
                My voice is something fresh in our community of game developers a
                nd I hope to use it to break the cycle of prejudice and misrepresentation
                in the games that I help craft. Beyond this, I'm a junior at Worcester Polytechnic
                Institute pursuing a degree in Interactive Media and Game Design. I have a
                soft spot for outrageously hot coffee and start each day by actually making my bed.</p>
            <h4>Why do I make games?</h4>
            <p>Well, I make games because I have to. Not because I’m being mandated
                by some academic assignment or external force, but because they are
                inside of me. I can’t think of anything else on this earth that I love
                more than developing, creating, or writing an artifact of entertainment.
                I also think that games provide a unique way to interact with an audience.
                You have the opportunity to do things like empower them, frustrate them,
                or enlighten them. You afford them the ability to take an active role in
                some narrative that has the potential to shift their perspective.</p>
            <h4>What kind of games do I want to make?</h4>
            <p>
                I want to make games that change the way people think. I want to make
                games that introduce potentially ignorant players to social and economic
                minorities that routinely face discrimination. I want to make games that
                disarm hatred and spread acceptance.
