    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>I'm a senior at Worcester Polytechnic
                Institute pursuing a degree in Interactive Media and Game Design. Beyond this, I'm an
                independent game developer and designer, writer, and musician. I have a
                soft spot for outrageously hot coffee and write a lot of poetry that no one will ever
                read. I sometimes feel like the only human that makes their bed every single morning.</p>
    <h4>Why do I make games?</h4>
    <p>I can’t think of anything else on this earth that I love
                more than developing, creating, or writing an artifact of entertainment.
                I also think that games provide a unique way to interact with an audience.
                You have the opportunity to do things like empower them, frustrate them,
                or enlighten them. You afford them the ability to take an active role in
                some narrative that has the potential to shift their perspective.</p>
    <h4>What kind of games do I want to make?</h4>
    <p> Well, I make a lot of games about my experiences as a transgender man - which, I feel,
                answers this question pretty thoroughly. I want to make games that introduce
                potentially ignorant players to social and economic minorities that routinely
                face discrimination. I want to make games that confront prejudice and spread
                acceptance.</p>

    <h4>Games</h4>
    <h5>Gotta Go</h5>
    <img src="images/gotta_go/gg1.PNG" alt="GG at QGCon" style = "width: 400px" class="center">

    <p></br>All of the characters have have just landed at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport and are
        excited about attending the Raleigh Innovations Technology Conference at the other end of the city.
        Unfortunately, they have taken advantage of the free refreshments during their respective flights
        and really “gotta go.” The characters must make their way through the streets of Raleigh trying to
        find a comfortable restroom to empty their bladder before reaching the convention. </p>

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>Gotta Go is a progression based board game with resource management elements that tackles the issue
        of anti-transgender bathroom legislation in the United States. I’m proud of this project in particular
        because it opened my eyes to the power and responsibility that we have as game developers. We can
        use our craft to educate and provide alternate perspectives for those who need them. Gotta Go
        features a cast of colorful characters with unique gender identities that are severely underrepresented
        in pop culture. Players navigate through the city of Raleigh, North Carolina collecting bladder tokens
        and trying to find restrooms that their character feels comfortable using. The event card system juxtaposes
        humorous events with realistic and sombre negative events that are drawn when a character is forced to use
        a restroom that they don’t identify with.</p>

    <h4>Public Speaking</h4>

    <h5>Gender Is Like A Sweater</h5>
    <p>
        This presentation explores gender identity and diversity in the context of modern media.
        It will cover topics such as the complexity of "passing," what it means to medically
        transition, and problematic representation. This talk will give insight into how to
        respectfully portray trans characters in games and discuss trans issues in everyday life.
