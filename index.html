    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Hi, I'm Leo Bunyea! I am a technological professional with expertise in interactive, educational media.
        I have experience working on multidisciplinary teams, developing and documenting software and hardware,
        and teaching core design concepts. I am also an award winning game designer and writer with a passion
        for serious and applied games. I'm also an independent game designer, writer, and programmer. Many of my projects
        are informed by my experience exploring my identity as a transgender man. Ultimately, I use my skill set as a
        developer and educator to advocate for queer and marginalized people.</p>
    <h4>What are my professional interests?</h4>
    <p>My professional interests exist at the intersection of technology access and education. I am particularly invested in using
        technology as a tool to ensure equitable learning. I am also passionate about bridging activism with my hobbies and work.</p>

    </div>
    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>“Athena At Night” is a steampunk, popup puzzle, visual book about a girl who defies fate through hard work and intellect.
        “Athena At Night” is targeted towards children from five to nine years of age. On this project, I served as lead artist and lead writer.</p>
    <p>
        Athena is a princess who has been cursed by the stars themselves to sleep while others in her castle are awake and be awake
        while others are asleep. Her parents have kept her confined to a specific wing of the castle, fearing that something terrible
        may happen to her without their supervision. Longing for an escape from both her loneliness and her physical constraints, Athena
        begins to build a flying machine. When the machine is eventually complete, she pilots it into the night sky breaking the curse.

    <i><p>Welcome to the Federal Anomalous Entities Research Team. You have been chosen for this position because you are the best of the best.
        For your first day, you’ll be interacting with Entity #2006. We can’t give you much more information over a channel as insecure as the internet,
        but I’m sure you’ll be fine. Succeed, and you’ll be an official part of one of the most elite government agencies in the US. Fail, and this
        conversation never happened.</p></i>
    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>The Containment Breach: Escape Room was an escape room built in six weeks and run by thirty graduate students on WPI's campus. For this project, I was
        on the writing team and responsible for generating any text needed for puzzles needed within the room. I also scripted, filmed, and edited a video to
        loop in the lobby, designed the lobby layout, and helped build the physical set.</p>

    <h4>Table-top Games</h4>
    <h5>Perspective Shift</h5>
    <img src="images/perspective_shift/ps1.PNG" alt="Perspective Shift" style = "width: 400px" class="center">

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>“Perspective Shift” is a social board game which combines and facilitates physical construction and conversation
        to enable open communication between its players. Platforms which encourage this nature of communication are
        increasingly necessary in the United States considering the nation’s current socio-political climate. The design
        of “Perspective Shift” is informed by practices used in play therapy to help participants feel more comfortable
        being vulnerable. Perspective Shift is subversive in its treatment of traditional goals and fail states. The
        context in which various game pieces are used is negotiated by the players themselves.</p>
    <p>“Perspective Shift’s” gameplay is segmented into four phases; negotiation, construction, drawing, and preservation.
        Each phase establishes conditions for the next phase and adds an additional, necessary layer of meaning to the whole
        experience. The first phase acts as a form of consent about what topic and feelings players are willing to openly
        discuss. The second nurtures a structured conversation that makes space for every person to contribute. The third
        phase acts as an exercise in literal perspective-taking and subsequently the formulation of other perspectives into
        language. The last phase, after players have engaged in meaningful conversation and thought about everyone else’s
        point of view, asks players to reach a consensus.

    <p></br><i>All of the characters have have just landed at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport and are
        excited about attending the Raleigh Innovations Technology Conference at the other end of the city.
        Unfortunately, they have taken advantage of the free refreshments during their respective flights
        and really “gotta go.” The characters must make their way through the streets of Raleigh trying to
        find a comfortable restroom to empty their bladder before reaching the convention. </i></p>

    <h6>What is it?</h6>
    <p>Gotta Go is a progression based board game with resource management elements that tackles the issue
        of anti-transgender bathroom legislation in the United States. It
        features a cast of colorful characters with unique gender identities that are severely underrepresented
        in popular culture. Players navigate through the city of Raleigh, North Carolina collecting bladder tokens
        and trying to find restrooms that their character feels comfortable using. The event card system juxtaposes
        humorous events with realistic and sombre negative events that are drawn when a character is forced to use
        a restroom that does not align with their identity.</p>

        This presentation explores gender identity and diversity in the context of modern media.
        It will cover topics such as the complexity of "passing," what it means to medically
        transition, and problematic representation. This talk will give insight into how to
        respectfully portray trans characters in games and discuss trans issues in everyday life.
